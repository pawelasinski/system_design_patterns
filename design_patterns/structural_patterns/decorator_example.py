"""Decorator

The `Decorator`_ pattern is a structural design pattern that allows dynamically adding new behaviors
to objects by wrapping them in wrapper classes. Instead of modifying the original objectâ€™s code,
decorators encapsulate additional functionality, providing a flexible alternative to inheritance
for extending object capabilities.

Why use it?
* Flexibility (dynamically modify object behavior without altering its code).
* Composition over inheritance (combine multiple behaviors without creating numerous subclasses).
* Open/Closed Principle (OCP) (extend functionality without modifying existing code).
* Cleaner code (encapsulates additional behaviors, reducing the complexity of class hierarchies).
