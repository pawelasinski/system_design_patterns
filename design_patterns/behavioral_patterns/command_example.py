"""Command

`Command_` is a behavioral design pattern that encapsulates a request as an object,
storing all the necessary details to execute, delay, queue, or undo the request when needed.
This abstraction allows greater flexibility in handling operations dynamically.

Why use it?
* Decouples sender and receiver (the request issuer doesnâ€™t need to know how it will be executed).
* Supports undo/redo operations (essential for actions that need reversibility
    (e.g., text editors, transactions)).
* Facilitates request queuing and scheduling (enables delayed or batched execution).
* Improves extensibility (new commands can be added without modifying existing code).
