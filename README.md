# System Design Notes

This repository contains notes, breakdowns, and practical examples on system design, covering key architectural patterns, scalable and fault-tolerant system design approaches, and trade-offs involved in architectural decisions.

## What’s Inside?
* **[Design Patterns](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns)** (typical solutions to common problems in software design. Each pattern is like a blueprint that you can customize to solve a particular design problem in your code): 
  * **Creational Patterns** provide various object creation mechanisms, which increase flexibility and reuse of existing code:
    * [Factory Method](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/factory-method)
    * [Abstract Factory](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/abstract-factory)
    * [Builder](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/builder)
    * [Prototype](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/prototype)
    * [Singleton](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/singleton)
  * **Structural Patterns** explain how to assemble objects and classes into larger structures while keeping these structures flexible and efficient:
    * [Adapter](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/adapter)
    * [Bridge](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/bridge)
    * [Composite](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/composite)
    * [Decorator](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/decorator)
    * [Facade](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/facade)
    * [Flyweight](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/flyweight)
    * [Proxy](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/proxy)
  * **Behavioral Patterns** are concerned with algorithms and the assignment of responsibilities between objects:
    * [Chain of Responsibility](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/chain-of-responsibility)
    * [Command](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/command)
    * [Iterator](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/iterator)
    * [Mediator](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/mediator)
    * [Memento](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/memento)
    * [Observer](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/observer)
    * [State](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/state)
    * [Strategy](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/strategy)
    * [Template Method](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/template-method)
    * [Visitor](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/visitor)
* 

## Who is this for?
* Developers looking to deepen their understanding of large-scale system architecture.
* Candidates preparing for system design interviews.
* Architects and engineers designing scalable and resilient apps and systems.
